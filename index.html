		<h3>UNTETHERED JAILBREAK ON IOS 9.2 -> 13.3 AND UP!!!</h3>
		<p>no. this isn't a prank or some bullshit, we promise this is real.</p>
		<p>only works up to 13.3 because there isn't a public kernel exploit for 13.3.1(iirc) and up.</p>
		<p>after a 13.3.1 and up kernel exploit is (HOPEFULLY) released, and a jailbreak is developed to go with it,</p>
		<p>it should be less than 4 hours before the untether can be ported.</p>
		<p>wenetaunthreader coming soon...</p>
