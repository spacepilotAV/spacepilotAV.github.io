    <p>this will, after you press the above button, continuously refresh, until it finds your refresh value, and your OUM value.</p>
    <p><b>IF IT STOPS REFRESHING AND YOU GET AN ERROR FROM SAFARI</b>, then refresh and continue.</p>
    <h6>What is an OUM?</h6>
    <p>an OUM (Out of Memory) is an error thrown by<br>JS when it is, well, out of memory.</p>
    <h6>Why should I do this?</h6>
    <p>If you're a normal, user, you probably don't need to.</p>
    <p>This is mainly designed for hackers who want to be able to pass the biggest<br>payload to JS without getting an OUM</p>
